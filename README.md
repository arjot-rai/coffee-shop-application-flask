# coffee-shop-application-flask
Coffee shop application with Flask library used to make the server and SQLite used for databases.

To intstall all the packages run `npm install`, in the directory which contains the package.json file is located.

Flask framework is used for
the server side and SQLite for the database. This project has a 3-tier
architecture. All the JavaScript and CSS files are made static. Flask has a builtin method to serve html files dynamically, which makes life easier of the developer easier as compared to NodeJS.

Testing of this new application was done in a similar manner to the coffee shop application made using nodejs, except that some
additional tools were available due to the use of python. For instance, pythonâ€™s built-in print
statement was helpful. Moreover, Flask has a debug mode available which makes it easier to find
the sources or error if any. It was specially made sure that the database was
reaching the required state after it was updated.
